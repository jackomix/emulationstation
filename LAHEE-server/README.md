## Usage

For detailed technical information on LAHEE's architecture, API protocol, and patching mechanism, see the [Technical Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

Latest stable release: https://github.com/akechi-haruka/LAHEE/releases

Latest unstable development build: https://nightly.link/akechi-haruka/LAHEE/workflows/dotnet/master

### Dolphin

1. Go to `<your user data location>\Config\RetroAchievements.ini`
and append a new entry named
`HostUrl = http://localhost:8000/`
2. Go to the directory where `Dolphin.exe` is located. If there are any `RA_Integration` files:
    1. If you want to be able to edit achievements, see "Patching RAIntegration".
    2. Otherwise delete those files.
3. Launch Dolphin, navigate to Tools > Achievements, and type in any desired username and any password.

### RetroArch

RetroArch has no ability to change the RA server name, so we need to patch that in the good old way.

1. Download https://github.com/akechi-haruka/hexedit2 and place the .exe next to `retroarch.exe`.
2. Create a backup copy of `retroarch.exe`
3. Open a command prompt in the folder where RetroArch is located and execute `hexedit2 multi -t StringASCII retroarch.exe retroarch.exe https://retroachievements.org http://localhost:8000`
4. Launch RetroArch, navigate to the achievements menu, and type in any desired username and any password.

### DuckStation, others

Other emulators may need to be patched generically as following:

1. Download https://github.com/akechi-haruka/hexedit2 and place the .exe next to your emulator .exe file.
2. Create a backup copy of your emulator.
3. Open a command prompt in the folder where your emulator is located and execute
   `hexedit2 multi -t StringASCII duckstation-qt-x64-ReleaseLTCG.exe duckstation-qt-x64-ReleaseLTCG.exe https://retroachievements.org/dorequest.php http://localhost:8000/dorequest.php`
    1. Make sure to replace the .exe file name.
    2. You should get at least 1 hit.
4. Launch the emulator, navigate to the achievements menu, and type in any desired username and any password.

## Web Viewer

Open http://localhost:8000/Web/ in your browser to see locked/unlocked achievements, records, status message and score.

To enable notifications and sound effects, allow them in your browser.

### Misc. features

If desired, an avatar can be placed in `<lahee root>\UserPic\<username>.png`.

## Adding achievements (from real site)

1. Open "appsettings.json".
2. Set "WebApiKey" to the Web API Key found on https://retroachievements.org/settings, aswell as "Username" and "Password" to your real RetroAchievements account.

then to add achievements:

### via Browser

This requires a userscript manager addon such as Greasemonkey.

Install this userscript: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akechi-haruka/LAHEE/refs/heads/master/Web/lahee.user.js

Afterwards, you will have a button on the game specific page to copy the set to LAHEE.
![https://github.com/akechi-haruka/LAHEE/blob/master/Readme/screenshot_userscript.png](https://github.com/akechi-haruka/LAHEE/blob/master/Readme/screenshot_userscript.png)

### via LAHEE console

In the LAHEE console, type `fetch XXXX` where XXXX is the game ID you want to get achievements for. This ID can be found in the URL of the achievements page (ex. for FFCC: https://retroachievements.org/game/3885, this would be 3885).

Alternatively, 

## Adding achievements (via RAIntegration)

From LAHEE 1.11 and above, you can use RAIntegration / "RetroAchievements Development" to add and modify achievements
directly in LAHEE via the Upload/Promote/Demote buttons.

### Patching RAIntegration

These steps are only required if your emulator loads RAIntegration from `RA_Integration[-x64].dll` or if you want to use
RAIntegration to edit achievements on LAHEE.

1. Download https://github.com/akechi-haruka/hexedit2 and place the .exe next to `Dolphin.exe`.
2. Run following:
   ```
   hexedit2 multi -t StringASCII RA_Integration.dll RA_Integration.dll https://retroachievements.org/dorequest.php http://localhost:8000/dorequest.php
   hexedit2 multi -t StringASCII RA_Integration.dll RA_Integration.dll https://retroachievements.org http://localhost:8000
   hexedit2 multi -t StringASCII RA_Integration-x64.dll RA_Integration-x64.dll https://retroachievements.org/dorequest.php http://localhost:8000/dorequest.php
   hexedit2 multi -t StringASCII RA_Integration-x64.dll RA_Integration-x64.dll https://retroachievements.org http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Adding achievements (manually / custom)

Achievement definitions must be placed in `<root>\<Data>\<gameid>-<optional_label>.<extension>`

- The optional label is simply for file organization convenience
  (ex. `3885-FFCCSubsetRareItems.json`)
- For core sets, simply copy the `####.json` file from `RAIntegration\Data`.
- For user sets, simply copy the `####-User.txt` file from `RAIntegration\Data`.
    - Latest supported RAIntegration version: 1.4.0.
- Achievement images must be placed in `<root>\lahee\Badge\<badgeid>.png`
- Game hash defitions must be placed in `<root>\<Data>\<gameid>-<optional_label>.hash.txt`
- Every line should depict one valid hash for this game+achievement set combo
- All `.zhash` files of the same ID are merged.

Note that the Game ID from the file name itself will override the Game ID that is stored inside the .json itself. This allows you to easily merge sets.

For example, to merge the core FFCC set (ID 3885) and the "Rare Drops" subset (ID 28855), name both files simply a variation of `3885-FFCC Core.json` and `3885-FFCC Rare Drops.json`, and both will be combined into one set and no longer requires patching your game hash.

## Capture Triggers

To define events (like screenshots or messages to OBS), define entries in appsettings.json under "Capture" as follow:

`{
"Trigger": string,
"Parameter": string,
"Delay": number
}`

Delay is the amount of milliseconds since the achievement trigger when this event should happen. Events can happen multiple times as well, i.e. you can make a screenshot at 0ms and another one at 2000ms.

### Trigger: `Screenshot`
Parameters: "Desktop" or "Window"

Take a screenshot from either the entire desktop or the currently active Window. Screenshots are saved in the Capture directory next to LAHEE.

### Trigger: `OBSWebsocket`
Parameters: The messageType to be sent to obs-websocket. See OBS' websocket's documentation for more information.

Sends a message to OBS, mostly used with parameter "SaveReplayBuffer".

## Config

To not have your changes overwritten on updates, you can create a copy of `appsettings.json` named
`appsetings.local.json` and make your changes there.

### LAHEE

* WebPort: the TCP port LAHEE runs under. If changed, emulator config or hexedits need to be adjusted.
* AutoSessionOnSingleUser: if only one user exists, LAHEE completely ignores authentication, and always logs the only
  existing user in, regardless of session tokens.
* LoadAsSingleSet: when true, all achievement sets will be merged to a single set.
* DisableLeaderboards: Disables all leaderboards from being tracked and from being shown in emulators.
* BadgeDirectory/DataDirectory/UserDirectory: Paths to folders LAHEE stores various files.
* PresenceHistoryLimit: The maximum number of presence (gameplay status) entries LAHEE should save. -1 for no limit.
  Might be cool to look back on the past, but set to a low number if you don't care or your save data becomes too big.
* AutoOpenBrowser: Opens your default browser with the web UI when LAHEE is started.
* RAFetch: Settings for downloading/fetching data from the official site, see "Adding achievements (from real site) -
  via LAHEE console"
    * AutoUpdateCodeNotes: Automatically updates code notes for the achievement code viewer when needed.
    * CheckSetRevisions: Checks and notifies for any data mismatch against the official server (new achievements, etc.)
    * SetRevisionCheckIncludeUnofficial: Whether or not to include "unofficial" achievements in the revision check.
* OBSWebsocketUrl: URL to your OBS instance for sending commands. Must not use authentication.
* LoadUnofficialAsOfficial: Send all unofficial achievements as official to the emulator. Is needed in a few emulators
  to work around them not sending Unofficial unlocks.
